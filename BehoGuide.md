## In General
- **Nuclear all the way for behos**.
  * *A few thermal/electro-magnetic exceptions are possible and even advised*.
- Difficulty scale:
  * (*Easy*) Lashers | Revivers | Howlers  (*Tough*)
- Use Beho Trials as a testing ground not to waste troops on field.
- Required:
  * **2 strong tanking units**.
    * **Defense & survivability = key**.
    * *Additional damage, repairs, shielding etc. = considered bonus*.
  * **3 accompanying units** that focus on:
    * (Additional) **damage = key**.
    * (Additional) **repairs and shielding = key**.
- Focus on:
  * **Vehicle & Unit enhancing upgrades in base**.
  * **Vehicle Threat Level**.
    * **High Threat level = targeted ( *way* ) more by behemoth**.
    * *Can be checked when viewing Vehicle Details*.
  * **Health** regarding Hero Talents, *especially for tanking units*.
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing Hero Specialties** *for heroes having that option ( f.e. `Smith`* ).
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing vehicle accessories**.
  * **Repair & Shield enhancing vehicle accessories**.
    * Keep the following difference in mind:
      * `Repair/Shield <Effect> Increase`: *for unit **self** repairs/shields only*.
      * `Repair/Shield <Received> Increase`: *for repairs/shields **received from other units***.
- **Experiment yourself** and copy successful working lineups & advice/feedback from other players.
- **Make minor adjustments only if a formation is nearly there**.
  * *Any small change could make a huge difference in outcome*.
  * *If that little extra shielding would make the difference, ask other players to help with additional Ark shielding*.
- ( *Optional* ) At the point Behos become more forgiving for a formation:
  * Defensive drone(s) can be replaced with damage dealing drone(s) for a slight speedup.
  * Defensive vehicle(s) can be replaced with damage dealing vehicle(s) for a slight speedup.
    * *Hence why you'll notice me using [ `Vito` + `Fission Walker` ] in screenshots instead of a tankier vehicle*.

## Formation Composition
- Advised must-haves:
 * **[ `Smith` + `Crimson` + `Diffusion Bomb` ]**
   * **Damage = key**.
   * *Better alternatives for `Smith` later on in season ( due to increased command cap )*.
 * **[ `Flora` + `Spotlight` + `Repair-All Field` ]**
   * **Energy Ability ( *better repairs* ) = key**.
   * *Less optimal alternative for `Repair-All Field`= `(purple) Emergency Repairs`*.
   * *Replace `Spotlight` with an alternative nuclear vehicle with lots of Energy Ability if needed for certain hero requirements.*
 * **[ `Ningal` + `Ark` + `Shield-All Barrier` ]**
   * **Shielding = key**.
   * *Less optimal shield providing alternative: `Parker`*.
 * **[ `Anunnaki` + `Tanking Vehicle` + `Repair Drone` ]**
   * **Mighty Shielding = key**.
 * **[ `Vito` + `Tanking Vehicle` + `Repair Drone` ]**
   * **A lot of bonus things = key**.
- Do **NOT** count out `Reverb`/`Stego` as tanking units.
  * *For me picking Reverb over Siren made the difference between loss and win*.
  * *I ignore `Fortress` vehicle because I believe Reverb and Stego are always the better choice*.
- At least for me, a [ `Ningal + Anunnaki` ] setup beats a [ `Ninurta` ] setup.
  * *Quoting Exadon, the key thing in a `Ninurta` build is [ `Lindsay + Electric Spark` ]*.
  * My ( *current* ) point of view on `Ninurta`: https://discord.com/channels/1110967420396507198/1111191587075145728/1165579266004635769 ( *first paragraph* ).

## Formation Positioning

> *Note in advance: I'd have taken Beho Trial screenshots for better grid view purposes, although I can't enter at the moment since current max level reached*.
