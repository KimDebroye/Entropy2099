> ## General Remarks
- **Nuclear all the way for behos**.
  * _A few thermal/electro-magnetic exceptions are possible and even advised_.
- Difficulty scale:
  * (_Easy_) Lashers | Revivers | Howlers  (_Tough_)
- Behemoths have different element attributes ( _thermal_ | _electro-magnetic_ | _nuclear_ ).
  * _On battle field, prioritize the type that is weak against the element of your formation_.
- Use Beho Trials as a testing ground not to waste troops on field.
- Required:
  * **2 strong tanking units**.
    * **Defense & survivability = key**.
    * _Additional damage, repairs, shielding etc. = considered bonus_.
  * **3 accompanying units** that focus on:
    * (Additional) **damage = key**.
    * (Additional) **repairs and shielding = key**.
    * (Additional) tanking.
- Focus on:
  * **Vehicle & Unit enhancing upgrades in base**.
  * **Vehicle Threat Level**.
    * **High Threat level = targeted ( _way_ ) more by behemoth**.
    * _Can be checked when viewing Vehicle Details_.
  * **Health** regarding Hero Talents, _especially for tanking units_.
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing Hero Specialties** _for heroes having that option ( f.e. `Smith` )_.
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing vehicle accessories**.
  * **Repair & Shield enhancing vehicle accessories**.
    * Mind the following difference:
      * `Repair/Shield <Received> Increase`: _for repairs/shields **received from other units**_.
      * `Repair/Shield <Effect> Increase`: _for unit **self** repairs/shields only_.
        * _Note: also **increases repairs/shields provided to other units**_. 
  * **Special vehicle accessories**.
    * Look out for and equip vehicle accessories that have added stats beneficial to a specific vehicle.
      * Overview of special accessories: `Vehicle Analysis Building` > _click_ > `Rewards Preview` ( _bottom left icon_ )
- **Experiment yourself** and work with successful working lineups & advice/feedback from other players.
  * **Make minor adjustments only if a formation is nearly there**.
    * _Any small change could make a huge difference in outcome_.
- ( _Optional_ ) At the point Behos become more forgiving for a formation:
  * Defensive drone(s) can be replaced with damage dealing drone(s) for a slight speedup.
  * Defensive vehicle(s) can be replaced with damage dealing vehicle(s) for a slight speedup.
- ( _Optional_ ) _If that little extra shielding would make the difference, ask other alliance members to help with additional Ark shielding_.
  * _Works on battlefield only_ ( _does not work in Grod Trials_ ).
  * _May come in handy if that little extra is needed for f.e. getting Hunter License Achievements_.

> ## Formation Positioning

> - Screenshots with a better grid view will be added gradually over time.<br />

<br />

> ### General Positioning Notes

- The units in screenshots below are positioned in an X-like shape.
- The X position is merely an example.
- On battle field, an X position isn't always recommended.
  * Sometimes f.e. a unit starts moving/repositioning when started, which may result in a failed attempt and troop loss.
  * _Personally, I do use X positioning as a default placement ( even on battle field )_.
    * _Setting up units near a beho becomes an automatism_.
    * _It's easy to adjust/do variations based on it keeping in mind the recommended unit distances_.

> ### Lashers | Default Positioning | 2 Tile Unit Distance

![Default Positioning \| Lasher](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Default%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Lasher.png)

> #### `Description`
- **Exactly 2 tiles in between all units**.
- **`Ark` Shield encapsulates all other units**.
  * = _Positioned right in the middle of all other units_.
  * **Time the popping of the `Ark` Shield well**.
    * _I usually pop it during the beho aoe prepping animation for f.e. Revivers, or a bit in advance to be sure_.

> #### `General Remarks`
- **Default Positioning works for `Lashers` as well as `Revivers`**.
- **While using `Ark` isn't a must for `Lashers` it is however strongly recommended for `Revivers`**.
- **`Howlers` require a positioning and formation change in order for units to survive**.
  * _[See further on](#howlers--separated-positioning--3-tile-unit-distance--no-ark) for more details_.

> ### Revivers | Default Positioning | 2 Tile Unit Distance

![Default Positioning \| Reviver](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Default%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Reviver.png)

> #### `Description`
- Refer to [Lashers \| Default Positioning \| 2 Tile Unit Distance](#lashers--default-positioning--2-tile-unit-distance) ( *similar setup* ).
- **Using `Ark` Shielding is strongly recommended for `Revivers`**.

<br />

> ### Howlers | Separated Positioning | 3 Tile Unit Distance | No Ark

![Separated X Positioning \| Howler](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Separated%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Howler%20(%203%20Tile%20Distance%20).png)

> #### `Description`
- **Separate ALL units** ( ***minimum 3 tiles in between*** ).
  * Reason: The AOE of the Howler reaches up to 3 tiles.
    * _If one unit gets hit by aoe, other units won't ( take damage )_.
- **Avoid using `Ark`**.
  * `Ark` Shield only reaches within 2 tiles ( *won't reach any of the other units, thereby losing its main benefit* ).
  * Replace `Ark` with a damage dealing vehicle that suits the hero combined with it.
    * _F.e. `Parker + Mirage + Shield Barrier`_.

<br />

> ## Formation Composition

> - The following are well tested combinations and therefore enlisted as a starting point.<br />
> - Nevertheless, mixed/alternative combinations of enlisted ( _as well as unlisted_ ) heroes/vehicles/weapons can be experimented with and may even yield a better outcome.

---

<br />

> ### Advised Must-Haves
- **[ `Ningal + Anunnaki` Build ]**
  - **[ `Smith + Crimson + Diffusion Bomb` ]**
    * **Damage = key**.
    * _Planned | To be tested/experimented with alternatives for `Smith` later on in season ( due to increased command cap )_.
      * `Elena`
        * _Basically the Flora for Thermals ( added damage with the applied Thermal Incineration effects from f.e. Spotlight )_.
        * _Behemoth damage reduction ( `Smith` has a fixed behemoth damage reduction, while `Elena`'s damage reduction is better for formation but has to be triggered )_.
      * `Orne` | `Marchioli`
        * _Huge damage dealers_.
        * _Compared to `Elena`, less interesting bonus abilities beho wise at first sight._
  - **[ `Flora + Spotlight + Repair-All Field` ]**
    * Reasons for mentioning Spotlight:
      * **High Energy Ability ( *=> better repairs* ) = key**.
      * _**+ Additional damage & debuff as a bonus**_.
      * _Replace `Spotlight` with an alternative vehicle with lots of Energy Ability if needed._
    * _Less optimal alternative for `Repair-All Field` = `(purple) Emergency Repairs`_.
  - **[ `Ningal/Parker + Ark/Mirage/... + Shield-All Barrier` ]**
    * **Shielding = key**.
    * **High Energy Ability ( *=> better shielding* ) = key**.
    * _`Parker` = recommended for higher level behos* | *requires sufficient command capability_.
    * _`Mirage` or any well balanced and damage outputting vehicle = recommended for `Howlers`_.
  - **[ `Anunnaki + Tanking Vehicle + Repair Drone` ]**
    * **Mighty Shielding = key**.
      * [ **Note Of Interest** ]
        * **Mighty Shield â‰  Regular Shield.**
          * Mighty Shield = Takes away all damage from a single behemoth hit ( _counts for normal as well as aoe attacks_ ).
          * Regular Shield = Takes away some damage from a single behemoth hit, but in most cases not all.
        * Unless `Anunnaki` is used as a ( _regular_ ) shield providing unit, there is no need to increase its `Shield Expert` Hero Talent.
          * _Rather spend upgrade tokens on Hero Talents `Battlefield Rationing` and/or `Self-Defense Awareness`._
  - **[ `Vito + Tanking Vehicle + Repair Drone` ]**
    * **A lot of bonus things = key**.
      * *Highest troop count = useful for repairs and survivability*.
      * *Increased support weapon dmg and recovery for all units*.
      * *Additional repairs for all units*.
- **[ `Ninurta` Build ]**
  * **[ `Ninurta + Bishop + Repair(-All) Drone` ]**
    * **`Ninurta` = Fair amount and frequent repairs for all units = key**.
    * **`Bishop` = Huge amount of stacked Fallout damage over time = key**.
      * _**Downside: Can only be used as a single Utu hero in formation**_ ( _1 or less Utu requirement_ ).
        * _Not combinable with [ `Ningal + Anunnaki` ] heroes_. 
  * **[ `Lindsay + (f.e.) Spotlight + Electric Spark/Shock Grenades` ]**
    * **Huge decreased behemoth aoe recharge time = key**.
  * \+ _Any of the previous combos mentioned._
    * _And/or other ones listed in f.e. First Victory Ranking, with the exception of `Ningal`, `Anunnaki` or any other Utu hero_.

> ### General Formation Notes
- **Make sure all tanking units get focused by behemoth = key element for survivability ( _besides fair amount of repairs & shielding_ )**.
  * Distributing behemoth damage over multiple units provides time for each unit to be repaired/shielded.
  * If a behemoth focuses mostly on but a single unit ( _that can't handle its damage_ ):
    * Experiment f.e. with a higher vehicle threat level on the other ( _preferably_ ) tanking unit(s).
- **Do NOT count out `Reverb`/`Stego` as tanking units**.
  * _For me picking Reverb over Siren made the difference between loss and win at some point_.
  * _Ignoring `Fortress` vehicle because ( at least for me ) Reverb and Stego are the better choice_.
  * _In fact: do not count out any hero/vehicle/drone when experimenting_.
- **Drone alternative(s) for any of the tanking units**:
  - **[ `Tidal Reactor` ]**
    * _Requires sufficient repairing and shielding of tanking hero by other units to recompensate the lack of a self repair drone_.
    * _Advised for higher level behos_.
    * _Personally, my current go-to_.
  - **[ `GN Shield` ]**
    * Single vehicle shielding + additional damage decrease for a few seconds.
    * _Personally, I've used this a few times due to requirement constraints during early season_.
    * _Nevertheless, I'd prefer `Tidal Reactor` when equally upgraded and if tanking unit can handle the behemoth damage_.
  - **[ `Laser Eyes - Mirror Space` ]** (?)
    * Possibly | Untested | Feedback Welcome.
    * _Personally, I'd still prefer `Tidal Reactor` when equally upgraded_.
- Since a composition takes into account many different factors ( _heroes owned_ | _amount of upgrades_ | _levels_ | _command cap_ | ... ):
  * Details in a composition that don't quite work out for another, may still work out for you and/or vice versa.
    * _This is where the experimental and 'inform yourself' part comes in_.
  * For different ideas/examples on ( *proven* ) formation compositions:
    * Check the in-game Behemoth Kill Rankings in chat window and/or First Victory Rankings in Grod Trials.
    * Ask in-game and/or on Discord.
