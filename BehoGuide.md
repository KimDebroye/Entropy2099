## General Remarks
- **Nuclear all the way for behos**.
  * *A few thermal/electro-magnetic exceptions are possible and even advised*.
- Difficulty scale:
  * (*Easy*) Lashers | Revivers | Howlers  (*Tough*)
- Use Beho Trials as a testing ground not to waste troops on field.
- Required:
  * **2 strong tanking units**.
    * **Defense & survivability = key**.
    * *Additional damage, repairs, shielding etc. = considered bonus*.
  * **3 accompanying units** that focus on:
    * (Additional) **damage = key**.
    * (Additional) **repairs and shielding = key**.
- Focus on:
  * **Vehicle & Unit enhancing upgrades in base**.
  * **Vehicle Threat Level**.
    * **High Threat level = targeted ( *way* ) more by behemoth**.
    * *Can be checked when viewing Vehicle Details*.
  * **Health** regarding Hero Talents, *especially for tanking units*.
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing Hero Specialties** *for heroes having that option ( f.e. `Smith`* ).
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing vehicle accessories**.
  * **Repair & Shield enhancing vehicle accessories**.
    * Keep the following difference in mind:
      * `Repair/Shield <Effect> Increase`: *for unit **self** repairs/shields only*.
      * `Repair/Shield <Received> Increase`: *for repairs/shields **received from other units***.
- **Experiment yourself** and copy successful working lineups & advice/feedback from other players.
- **Make minor adjustments only if a formation is nearly there**.
  * *Any small change could make a huge difference in outcome*.
  * *If that little extra shielding would make the difference, ask other players to help with additional Ark shielding*.
- ( *Optional* ) At the point Behos become more forgiving for a formation:
  * Defensive drone(s) can be replaced with damage dealing drone(s) for a slight speedup.
  * Defensive vehicle(s) can be replaced with damage dealing vehicle(s) for a slight speedup.
    * *Hence why you'll notice me using [ `Vito` + `Fission Walker` ] in screenshots instead of a tankier vehicle*.

## Formation Composition
- Advised must-haves:
  * **[ `Smith + Crimson + Diffusion Bomb` ]**
    * **Damage = key**.
    * *Better alternatives for `Smith` later on in season ( due to increased command cap )*.
  * **[ `Flora + Spotlight + Repair-All Field` ]**
    * **Energy Ability ( *better repairs* ) = key**.
    * *Less optimal alternative for `Repair-All Field` = `(purple) Emergency Repairs`*.
    * *Replace `Spotlight` with an alternative nuclear vehicle with lots of Energy Ability if needed for certain hero requirements.*
  * **[ `Ningal + Ark + Shield-All Barrier` ]**
    * **Shielding = key**.
    * *Less optimal shield providing alternative: `Parker`*.
  * **[ `Anunnaki + Tanking Vehicle + Repair Drone` ]**
    * **Mighty Shielding = key**.
  * **[ `Vito + Tanking Vehicle + Repair Drone` ]**
    * **A lot of bonus things = key**.
- Do **NOT** count out `Reverb`/`Stego` as tanking units.
  * *For me picking Reverb over Siren made the difference between loss and win*.
  * *I ignore `Fortress` vehicle because I believe Reverb and Stego are always the better choice*.
- At least for me, a [ `Ningal + Anunnaki` ] setup beats a [ `Ninurta` ] setup.
  * *Quoting Exadon, the key thing in a `Ninurta` build is [ `Lindsay + Electric Spark` ]*.
  * My ( *current* ) point of view on `Ninurta`:
    - Good hero, provides fair amount and frequent repairs for all.
    - Disables vehicle default and special shots but spits damage based 350% of vehicle dmg to surrounding foes within 5 tiles.
    - Biggest downside imo:
      * Can only be used as a single Utu hero in formation ( *1 or less Utu requirement* ).
      * Not combinable with [ `Ningal + Anunnaki` ] setup.

## Formation Positioning

*Note in advance: I'd have taken Beho Trial screenshots for better grid view purposes, although I can't enter at the moment since current max level has been reached*. *Screenshots with a better grid view will be added later on.*

### Lashers | Default X Positioning

![Default X Positioning \| Lasher](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Default%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Lasher.png)

#### **Description**
- **Exactly 2 spots in between all units**.
- **Ark Shield encapsulates all other units**.
  * = *Positioned right in the middle of all other units*.
  * **Time the popping of the Ark Shield well**.
    * *I usually pop it during the beho aoe prepping animation for f.e. Revivers, or a bit in advance to be sure*.
#### **General Remarks**
- **Default X Positioning works for `Lashers` as well as `Revivers`**.
- **`Howlers` require a minor positioning change for tanking units in order for troops to survive**.
  * *[See further on](#howlers--separated-x-positioning) for more details*.

### Revivers | Default X Positioning

![Default X Positioning \| Reviver](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Default%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Reviver.png)

#### **Description**
- Refer to [Lashers \| Default X Positioning](#lashers--default-x-positioning) ( *similar setup* ).

### Howlers | Separated X Positioning

![Separated X Positioning \| Howler](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Separated%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Howler.png)

#### **Description**
- **Separate both tankers** ( ***minimum 3 spots in between*** ).
  * *While the Ark Shield won't reach, the Howler hitting them with aoe won't damage Ark nor other units*.
- **Ark should (*still*) encapsulate other 2 less tanking units**.
  * Depending on formation, save your Ark Shield. Only pop if Howler attacks Ark or any of the damage dealers for a second time.
    * In other words: **Ark Shield on Howlers = panic trigger only** ( & ***keep in mind, it won't reach tankers*** ).
