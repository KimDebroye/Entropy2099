## General Remarks
- **Nuclear all the way for behos**.
  * *A few thermal/electro-magnetic exceptions are possible and even advised*.
- Difficulty scale:
  * (*Easy*) Lashers | Revivers | Howlers  (*Tough*)
- Use Beho Trials as a testing ground not to waste troops on field.
- Required:
  * **2 strong tanking units**.
    * **Defense & survivability = key**.
    * *Additional damage, repairs, shielding etc. = considered bonus*.
  * **3 accompanying units** that focus on:
    * (Additional) **damage = key**.
    * (Additional) **repairs and shielding = key**.
- Focus on:
  * **Vehicle & Unit enhancing upgrades in base**.
  * **Vehicle Threat Level**.
    * **High Threat level = targeted ( *way* ) more by behemoth**.
    * *Can be checked when viewing Vehicle Details*.
  * **Health** regarding Hero Talents, *especially for tanking units*.
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing Hero Specialties** *for heroes having that option ( f.e. `Smith`* ).
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing vehicle accessories**.
  * **Repair & Shield enhancing vehicle accessories**.
    * Keep the following difference in mind:
      * `Repair/Shield <Effect> Increase`: *for unit **self** repairs/shields only*.
      * `Repair/Shield <Received> Increase`: *for repairs/shields **received from other units***.
  * **Special vehicle accessories**.
    * Look out for and equip vehicle accessories that have added stats beneficial to a specific vehicle.
      * Overview of special accessories: `Vehicle Analysis Building` > *click* > `Rewards Preview` ( *bottom left icon* )
- **Experiment yourself** and copy successful working lineups & advice/feedback from other players.
  * **Make minor adjustments only if a formation is nearly there**.
    * *Any small change could make a huge difference in outcome*.
- ( *Optional* ) At the point Behos become more forgiving for a formation:
  * Defensive drone(s) can be replaced with damage dealing drone(s) for a slight speedup.
  * Defensive vehicle(s) can be replaced with damage dealing vehicle(s) for a slight speedup.
- ( *Optional* ) *If that little extra shielding would make the difference, ask other alliance members to help with additional Ark shielding*.
  * *Works on battlefield only* ( *does not work in Grod Trials* ).
  * *May come in handy if that little extra is needed for f.e. getting Hunter License Achievements*.

## Formation Composition

*Note in advance: The following are well tested combinations and therefore enlisted as a starting point.
Nevertheless mixed combinations of enlisted ( as well as unlisted ) heroes/vehicles/weapons can be experimented with and may even yield a better outcome.*

### Advised Must-Haves
- **[ `Ningal + Anunnaki` Build ]**
  - **[ `Smith + Crimson + Diffusion Bomb` ]**
    * **Damage = key**.
    * *Better alternatives for `Smith` later on in season ( due to increased command cap )*.
  - **[ `Flora + Spotlight + Repair-All Field` ]**
    * Reasons for mentioning Spotlight:
      * **High Energy Ability ( *=> better repairs* ) = key**.
      * ***+ Additional damage & debuff as a bonus***.
      * *Replace `Spotlight` with an alternative vehicle with lots of Energy Ability if needed.*
    * *Less optimal alternative for `Repair-All Field` = `(purple) Emergency Repairs`*.
  - **[ `Ningal/Parker + Ark/Mirage/... + Shield-All Barrier` ]**
    * **Shielding = key**.
    * **High Energy Ability ( *=> better shielding* ) = key**.
    * *`Parker` = advised for higher level behos* | *requires sufficient command capability*.
    * *`Mirage` or any well balanced and damage outputting vehicle = recommended for Howlers*.
  - **[ `Anunnaki + Tanking Vehicle + Repair Drone` ]**
    * **Mighty Shielding = key**.
      * [ **Note Of Interest** ]
        * **Mighty Shield =/= Regular Shield.**
          * Mighty Shield = Takes away all damage from a single behemoth hit ( *counts for normal as well as aoe attacks* ).
          * Regular Shield = Takes away some damage from a single behemoth hit, but in most cases not all.
        * Unless `Anunnaki` is used as a ( *regular* ) shield providing unit, there is no need to increase its `Shield Expert` Hero Talent.
          * *Rather spend upgrade tokens on Hero Talents `Battlefield Rationing` and/or `Self-Defense Awareness`.*
  - **[ `Vito + Tanking Vehicle + Repair Drone` ]**
    * **A lot of bonus things = key**.
      * *Highest troop count = useful for repairs and survivability*.
      * *Increased support weapon dmg and recovery for all units*.
      * *Additional repairs for all units*.
- **[ `Ninurta` Build ]**
  * **[ `Ninurta + Bishop + Repair(-All) Drone` ]**
    * **`Ninurta` = Fair amount and frequent repairs for all units = key**.
    * **`Bishop` = Huge amount of stacked Fallout damage over time = key**.
      * ***Downside: Can only be used as a single Utu hero in formation*** ( *1 or less Utu requirement* ).
        * *Not combinable with [ `Ningal + Anunnaki` ] heroes*. 
  * **[ `Lindsay + (f.e.) Spotlight + Electric Spark/Shock Grenades` ]**
    * **Huge decreased behemoth aoe recharge time = key**.
  * + *Any of the previous combos mentioned.
    * *And/or other ones listed in f.e. First Victory Ranking, with the exception of `Ningal` and/or `Anunnaki`*.

### General Remarks
- **Make sure all tanking units get focused by behemoth = key element for survivability ( *besides fair amount of repairs & shielding* )**.
  * Distributing behemoth damage over multiple units provides time for each unit to be repaired/shielded.
  * If a behemoth focuses mostly on but a single unit ( that can't handle its damage ):
    * Experiment f.e. with a higher vehicle threat level on the other ( *preferably* ) tanking unit(s).
- **Do NOT count out `Reverb`/`Stego` as tanking units**.
  * *For me picking Reverb over Siren made the difference between loss and win*.
  * *Ignoring `Fortress` vehicle because ( at least for me ) Reverb and Stego are the better choice*.
  * *In fact: do not count out any hero/vehicle/drone when experimenting*.
- **Drone alternative(s) for any of the tanking units**:
  - **[ `Tidal Reactor` ]**
    * *Requires sufficient repairing and shielding of tanking hero by other units to recompensate the lack of a self repair drone*.
    * *Advised for higher level behos*.
    * *Personally, my current go-to*.
  - **[ `GN Shield` ]**
    * Single vehicle shielding + additional damage decrease for a few seconds.
    * *Personally, I've used this a few times due to requirement constraints during early season*.
    * *Nevertheless, I'd prefer `Tidal Reactor` when equally upgraded and if tanking unit can handle the behemoth damage*.
  - **[ `Laser Eyes - Mirror Space` ]** (?)
    * Possibly | Untested | Feedback Welcome.
    * *Personally, I'd still prefer `Tidal Reactor` when equally upgraded*.
- Since a composition takes into account many different factors ( *heroes owned* | *amount of upgrades* | *levels* | *command cap* | ... ):
  * Details in a composition that don't quite work out for another, may still work out for you and/or vice versa.
    * *This is where the experimental and 'inform yourself' part comes in*.
  * For different ideas/examples on ( *proven* ) formation compositions:
    * Check the in-game Behemoth Kill Rankings in chat window and/or First Victory Rankings in Grod Trials.
    * Ask in-game and/or on Discord.

## Formation Positioning

*Note in advance: Screenshots with a better grid view will be added gradually over time.*

### Lashers | Default X Positioning

![Default X Positioning \| Lasher](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Default%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Lasher.png)

#### `Description`
- **Exactly 2 tiles in between all units**.
- **Ark Shield encapsulates all other units**.
  * = *Positioned right in the middle of all other units*.
  * **Time the popping of the Ark Shield well**.
    * *I usually pop it during the beho aoe prepping animation for f.e. Revivers, or a bit in advance to be sure*.
#### `General Remarks`
- **Default X Positioning works for `Lashers` as well as `Revivers`**.
- **`Howlers` require a minor positioning change for tanking units in order for troops to survive**.
  * *[See further on](#howlers--separated-x-positioning--3-tile-distance--no-ark) for more details*.

### Revivers | Default X Positioning

![Default X Positioning \| Reviver](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Default%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Reviver.png)

#### `Description`
- Refer to [Lashers \| Default X Positioning](#lashers--default-x-positioning) ( *similar setup* ).

---

### Howlers | Separated X Positioning | 3 Tile Distance | No Ark

![Separated X Positioning \| Howler](https://github.com/KimDebroye/Entropy2099/blob/main/Assets/Beho%20Guide/Separated%20X%20Positioning%20-%20Howler%20(%203%20Tile%20Distance%20).png)

#### `Description`
- **Separate ALL units** ( ***minimum 3 tiles in between*** ).
  * Reason: The AOE of the Howler reaches up to 3 tiles.
    * *If one unit gets hit by aoe, other units won't ( take damage )*.
- **Do NOT use `Ark`**.
  * `Ark` Shield only reaches within 2 tiles ( *won't reach any of the other units* ).
  * Replace `Ark` with a damage dealing vehicle that suits the hero combined with it.
    * *F.e. `Parker + Mirage + Shield Barrier`*.
