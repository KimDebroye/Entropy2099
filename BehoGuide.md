## General Advise
- **Nuclear all the way for behos**.
  * *A few thermal/electro-magnetic exceptions are possible and even advised*.
- Difficulty scale:
  * (*Easy*) Lashers | Revivers | Howlers  (*Tough*)
- Use Beho Trials as a testing ground not to waste troops on field.
- Required:
  * **2 strong tanking units**.
    * **Defense & survivability = key**.
    * *Additional damage, repairs, shielding etc. = considered bonus*.
  * **3 accompanying units** that focus on:
    * (Additional) **damage = key**.
    * (Additional) **repairs and shielding = key**.
- Focus on:
  * **Vehicle & Unit enhancing upgrades in base**.
  * **Vehicle Threat Level**.
    * **High Threat level = targeted ( *way* ) more by behemoth**.
    * *Can be checked when viewing Vehicle Details*.
  * **Health** regarding Hero Talents, *especially for tanking units*.
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing Hero Specialties** *for heroes having that option ( f.e. `Smith`* ).
  * **Grod dmg & def enhancing vehicle accessories**.
  * **Repair & Shield enhancing vehicle accessories**.
    * Keep the following difference in mind:
      * `Repair/Shield <Effect> Increase`: *for unit **self** repairs/shields only*.
      * `Repair/Shield <Received> Increase`: *for repairs/shields **received from other units***.
- **Experiment yourself** and copy successful working lineups & advice/feedback from other players.
- **Make minor adjustments only if a formation is nearly there**.
  * *Any small change could make a huge difference in outcome*.
  * *If that little extra shielding would make the difference, ask other players to help with additional Ark shielding*.
- ( *Optional* ) At the point Behos become more forgiving for a formation:
  * Defensive drone(s) can be replaced with damage dealing drone(s) for a slight speedup.
  * Defensive vehicle(s) can be replaced with damage dealing vehicle(s) for a slight speedup.
    * *Hence why you'll notice me using [ `Vito` + `Fission Walker` ] in screenshots instead of a tankier vehicle*.
